        [jpn]. Some suggest that both languages are possibly distantly related to
        the Altaic group. Dialect boundaries generally correspond to provincial boundaries.
        Some dialects are not easily intelligible with others (Voegelin and Voegelin
        1977). The suffix
    - -do
    - on dialect names means Province. Comprehension of standard Korean may be lower
        on Cheju Island.
