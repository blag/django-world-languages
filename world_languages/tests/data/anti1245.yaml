        creoles. May be similar to English Creoles of the Virgin Islands and Netherlands
        Antilles. One dialect is spoken mainly by older generations who live in Jennings
        and Bolans villages
    - near Johnson. People perceive the Southern variety
    - spoken along Fig Tree Drive Road from Swetes to Bolans
    - as being most different and difficult to understand. Barbudan is perceived as
        being more linguistically distant than the Creole English of Montserrat Point
        (2003 K. Decker).

    other_comments: Most villagers deny the existence of a creole, though they speak
        it. Although some negative attitudes toward it, its use in the community is
        quite strong. Its uniqueness and cultural role is valued. Many migrated to
        Antigua from Montserrat after the eruption of Soufriere Hills volcano on 18
        July, 1995. Christian.
